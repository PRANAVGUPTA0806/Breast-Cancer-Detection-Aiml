## 🤖 What is MedRiskPro?

MedRiskPro is a machine learning-based system that aims to detect breast cancer and diabetes using patient data. This system also says the estimated insurance costs associate with each condition. This project uses various python libraries such as Numpy for performing numerical operations, Pandas for manipulating data, Scikit-learn for algorithm of machine learning and Matplotlib for visualizing data. A dataset that has recorded patient’s information along with their respective insurance coverage was collected and preprocessed using these libraries.

Future work includes expanding the system to detect additional diseases and integrating a feature to recommend nearby hospitals based on the patient's diagnosed condition.


## 🚀 How MedRiskPro Works

Several Machine learning models like logistic regression, linear regression, SVM and KNN were trained on this preprocessed dataset.Breast cancer is done by using logistic regression modelThe insurance cost prediction is done by utilizing linear regression models. The findings of this project may have a significant influence on early detection of diseases as well as management of healthcare costs. By offering accurate timely forecasts, MedRiskPro can help health care practitioners make rational choices leading to better outcomes for patients while decreasing financial burden.
